            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. That a man cannot be too Religious:</hi> This he confidently aſſerts, <hi>Sect. 33.</hi> both of the <hi>intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or degree, and of the <hi>extenſion</hi> or number of rites and ceremonies, taken into the worſhip of God, <hi>ſect. 34.</hi> A diſtinction or two, will cleare the way. A man may be ſaid to be too <hi>Religious,</hi> either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:59453:3"/>he gives more to God than he deſerves, but ſo he cannot be <hi>too Religious;</hi> or becauſe he gives more than he <hi>requires,</hi> by the rule of worſhip; and ſo a man, may be too Religious. <hi>2.</hi> In regard of <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip commanded,</hi> eſpecially naturall worſhip, a man cannot be too <hi>Religious,</hi> in reference to the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> of the Devotion; as in <hi>love, fear, truſt</hi> in God: (though in inſtituted worſhip, a man may be <hi>too Religious:</hi> as if he pray, or Faſt to the waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his health, or neglect of his calling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Put in <hi>uncommanded</hi> worſhip, the leaſt <hi>Addition</hi> to the Rule of Worſhip, is <hi>too much,</hi> and ſuch a man, may be ſaid to be <hi>too Religious.</hi> This I prove.</p>
            <p n="1">

            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Religion, (ſaies the great <hi>Schoolman</hi>) is a morall virtue (or very like is) and ſtands betweene <hi>2.</hi> extremes; <hi>ergo.</hi> a man may as well be too much Religious, as too little.</p>

                        <hi>There was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe of abrogation of thoſe ceremonies (though</hi> Bellarmine <hi>conceald it</hi>) viz. <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did load the Conſcience, with a yoake of multitude of Ceremonies: and this is common to thoſe, and to the Traditions of men.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>§. 32. But the Doctor gives his vote, to the old Rule; <q>
                        <hi>Ceremonies muſt be few and wholeſome.</hi>

                     </q> But this is to unvote
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59453:19"/>the old Rule in part: For if they be <hi>Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious,</hi> wholſome, no matter how many they be: yea, <hi>"if but negatively as harmeleſſe,</hi> which is a dore wide enough to let in moſt of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Superſtitions; what harme is there in many of them? good <hi>innocent Ceremonies,</hi> as ſome have called them: But if poſitively for <hi>edification</hi> (as all <hi>willworſhipers</hi> thinke of their own inventions) is that a plea to beare men out, in the multitude of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the worſhip of God?

Hee ſeemes to make the difference of the <hi>Holineſs,</hi> from their ſeverall <hi>Seperations,</hi> to be onely <hi>graduall;</hi> but wee ſuppoſe it to be <hi>ſpecificall,</hi> at leaſt, betweene the <hi>Seperation</hi> of God or Chriſt, and that of the <hi>Church</hi> (to ſay nothing yet of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>) And withall, wee ſay, we deſire a proofe, that any but <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> guided by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> can make any thing <hi>properly Holy:</hi> Now to make a thing <hi>properly holy,</hi> is not, to ſeparate it onely to <hi>holy uſes</hi> from common, (as the Doctor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines it. <hi>Sect.</hi> 50.) but to make it, 1. a <hi>part</hi> of worſhip, 2. to be <hi>efficatious</hi> to work and convey <hi>holineſs,</hi> to him that rightly uſes it: 3. to make the ſervice &amp; perſon, <hi>more accepted.</hi> 4. To give a ground of <hi>expectation</hi> of a <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> upon ſome <hi>promiſe</hi> thereof in the word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this ſenſe none but God alone, can <hi>Sanctifie</hi> and Seperate any thing, to <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> from common <hi>uſes.</hi> All which the Doctor either takes no notice of, or takes as granted, <hi>others</hi> may doe. For he ſaies, <q>
                        <hi>The way to diſcern, whither we exceed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59453:23"/>(that is, be Superſtitious) in any of thoſe afore, and place more holineſs than is due to them, is to account them holy, in a degree proportioned to the authority of him that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated them.</hi>
                     </q> Wee ſhall ſpeake ſomething conſiderable to this. For 1. The difference between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, and the reſt is not well, or not diſtinctly laid out: For the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> authority was alſo <hi>Divine,</hi> by Chriſts commiſſion. 2. Then it followes, that the Authority of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in their <hi>Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> differed much from that of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Church,</hi> &amp; the reſt, as much as <hi>Divine</hi> &amp; humane. 3. The precept or example of the <hi>Univerſal Church</hi> (as it cannot be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ever to have concurred, in making any thing <hi>holy,</hi> there never having been an <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menicall Councill,</hi> truly ſo called, ſo) cannot make any thing <hi>properly holy,</hi> with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects afore ſaid; but onely <hi>improperly,</hi> with reſpect to <hi>holy things</hi> or <hi>duties,</hi> ſo made by God: <hi>e. g.</hi> In <hi>times</hi> or <hi>places</hi> ſeperated, by God or men; there is this difference (beſides thoſe above) that <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> ſanctified by God, require <hi>holy duties,</hi> to till them up. But ſeperated by men, they are to wait upon <hi>Holy duties.</hi> In the firſt, the duties are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the <hi>Time,</hi> or <hi>Places</hi> ſake: In the other, the time or place, are appointed for the <hi>Duties</hi> ſake: but this is to make <hi>any Time,</hi> or any <hi>Place,</hi> when and where
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59453:24"/>thoſe <hi>duties</hi> are performed, as <hi>holy</hi> as all other times or places, that is, the one no more <hi>Holy</hi> than another. We therefore deny, that either the <hi>Univerſall Church,</hi> or any <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> Church, or any <hi>private</hi> man, can make any thing <hi>properly Holy:</hi> which the Doctor doth not at all undertake to prove. Onely thus he goes on; <q>
                        <hi>If that which is thus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated, be by Chriſt himſelf, I ſhall count it holy in that degree, and my ſelfe obliged by virtue of Divine precept, and ſo of the reſt; and then I offend not.</hi>
                     </q> But 1. I ſuppoſe the Doctor will account himſelfe obliged to an Apoſtolicall inſtitution, by Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept alſo: I had thought Apoſtolicall
<note n="*" place="margin">Hoe thought and ſaid ſo, in his firſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, <hi>ſect.</hi> 22. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Doctrines and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, are ſo owned by Chriſt himſelfe, that what is truly A poſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, is immediately and by neceſſary conſequence, divine and infallible <hi>Sect.</hi> 52.</note> and Divine, had been both one with the Doctor; but I perceive he makes them differ, and yet differences <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> from <hi>Eccleſiaſticall;</hi> as if the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were neither <hi>Divine,</hi> nor <hi>Humane;</hi> but ſomething between both. 2. By this diſtinction of his, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their <hi>groſſeſt Superſtition,</hi> in placing <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> in things, times, places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by borrowing the Doctors anſwer; <q>
                        <hi>They may ſay, they account them holy, but either by the authority of the generall, or particular Church of</hi> Rome,</q> and that is no <hi>Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ſaies he, ſay they.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:59453:24"/>
                  <p>§. 40. But he goes on, <q>
                        <hi>If my voluntary oblation, I perform as a voluntary oblation, and onely expect that God that hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to accept ſuch, will accept it; all this while I am not blameworthy.</hi>
                     </q> But 1. what meanes he by his <hi>voluntary</hi> oblation? If his <hi>willingneſs</hi> in tendering <hi>commanded</hi> worſhip, he cannot doe that <hi>worſhip</hi> aright, without reſpect to the command: If <hi>voluntary worship</hi> of his own, without a command, he hath no <hi>promiſe</hi> of acceptance, and ſo can expect none. Yea, he may rather <hi>expect,</hi> or fear puniſhment, threatned in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Commandement, to ſuch <hi>worſhip.</hi> 2. The Dr. may remember, that <hi>Sect.</hi> 45. he blamed that for <hi>Superstition,</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>when virtue is placed in ſome things, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, or by the rule of the word, does not belong to them,</hi>
                     </q> and gives the reaſon <hi>Sect,</hi> 46. <q>
                        <hi>becauſe that addes to the promiſes of the Goſpell, and faſtens a promiſe on Chriſt which he hath not made.</hi>
                     </q> Now how will hee free himſelfe from <hi>Superſtition,</hi> in his <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary oblation,</hi> that is, his <hi>uncommanded worſhip,</hi> unleſſe hee can ſhew a <hi>promiſe</hi> in the Goſpell, for ſuch acceptance. For naturally there is no ſuch <hi>Virtue</hi> in a Willworſhip; and <hi>Inſtitution</hi> hee cannot plead; for that were a <hi>Contradiction; viderit ipſe.</hi> But hee ſaies ſtill; <q>
                        <hi>In caſe of reſolution, and vow, adde that reſpect in my performance, which is due to ſuch, and I am not blameworthy.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:59453:25"/>If hee meane, that his <hi>reſolution</hi> and <hi>vow,</hi> makes his <hi>voluntary oblation</hi> more <hi>accepted;</hi> he addes to his <hi>Superſtition,</hi> to ſecond <hi>Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip</hi> with a vow, and ſo <hi>profanes</hi> his vow, as well as the worſhip of God. If he meane, that his vow is a further <hi>degree</hi> of worſhip; what will hee anſwer to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who make <hi>vowes</hi> of <hi>ſingle</hi> life, and <hi>povertie,</hi> &amp;c. to be a <hi>ſpeciall worſhip</hi> of God; which he rejects. If he ſay, their <hi>Vowes</hi> are of things unlawfull, but mine of things lawfull: I grant this difference, but then ſay, that in making thoſe vowes, or <hi>things vowed</hi> to be <hi>parts</hi> of the worſhip of God, they both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and both are <hi>Superſtitious.</hi>

Beſides, in <hi>deviſed</hi> worſhip, it is not enough to free from guilt of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> to ſay or think, I account this or that holy, onely by the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and not of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is the <hi>Author</hi> of ſuch <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> he

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59453:37"/>and piety, in their worſhip, and yet to all orthodox known to be <hi>fooliſh</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious.

                     </q> This compariſon is ill laid; For rage and luſt are for kind confeſſedly wicked things.

                  <p>To conclude this argument, let the Doctor note it once for all, that the words are not; <q>
                        <hi>Which things have a ſhew of wiſdom and of Willworſhip, and of Humility and of not ſparing the body.</hi>

                     </q>) The difference between a <hi>Precept,</hi> and a <hi>Grace,</hi> is granted; but that a <hi>Grace</hi> ſhould not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige, unleſſe the <hi>matter</hi> be commanded him, by ſome other command, is not true. For <hi>Grace given,</hi> being a <hi>Talent,</hi> is given on purpoſe to improve, as well as a precept; This is clear as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <q>
                        <hi>The manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, is given to every one, to profit withall,</hi> and in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10.</q> So in the Parable of the <hi>Talents,</hi> the <hi>ſcope</hi> whereof is, <q>
                        <hi>That whatever Talent any man is be-truſted
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59453:56"/>with, the intention of the Doner is, that he ſhould improve it, to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi>
                     </q> though he lay no <hi>command</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly upon him: And the not uſing of it, is puniſhed ſeverely: <hi>Take him, and caſt him,</hi> &amp;c. for hee acknowledgeth his <hi>Lord did</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the improvement; <hi>I knew,</hi> &amp;c. whats the ſecond difference?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <q>
                        <hi>Becauſe it is the deſign of a precept, to lay an obligation, and that</hi> ſub periculo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimae, <hi>if not obeyed; but of grace not ſo, but onely to ſtrengthen and incline, which he that makes uſe of, as he ſhould, is promiſed a reward,</hi>
                     </q> &amp;c. This is ſtrange Divinity: Does God give <hi>Grace</hi> onely to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> and incline, and leave men <hi>free</hi> to <hi>uſe</hi> it, or not <hi>uſe</hi> it? ſo <hi>grace</hi> might be given in vaine: But does not Saint <hi>Math.</hi> ſay, <q>
                        <hi>Take him and caſt him into utter darkneſſe,</hi>
                     </q> for not uſing his Talent? and is he not threatned with loſs of his Talent, for not uſing it? and is not that a puniſhment for ſome ſin? yes, <q>
                        <hi>but its clear by Saint</hi> Luke, 19.13. <hi>that there was a precept of occupying; to which the puniſhment was apportioned,</hi>
                     </q> True, but had here been no ſuch particular precept, yet the <hi>Gift</hi> it ſelf implyed that <hi>duty</hi> of imployment, and therefore <hi>Mathew</hi> leaves that out; And there he acknowledges preſently, <q>
                        <hi>I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the bringing God no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>return of all his grace, is a great and a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59453:56"/>damning ſin.</hi>
                     </q> Thats true, ſay I, when he gives any <hi>grace,</hi> (though he ſay nothing) even by the Law of <hi>Creation,</hi> whereby the <hi>rationall Creature</hi> is bound to be <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to the glory of his Creator: But this laſt <hi>grant,</hi> hee in a manner, takes away againe in the next words; <q>
                        <hi>But then, that comes not home, to to prove it a ſinne, to omit the doing of any one particular, in that degree, which Gods grace enables me to doe; there being no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi> ad ſemper, <hi>or</hi> ad gradum; <hi>to doe it alwaies, or in ſuch a degree.</hi>
                     </q> But ſurely, as <hi>grace</hi> it ſelf, ſo any <hi>meaſure</hi> or <hi>degree</hi> of grace (being a <hi>Talent</hi> alſo) requires a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable <hi>return,</hi> to that degree.</p>
                  <p>The Lord, in the parable expected an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of of <hi>one</hi> Talent, for his <hi>one</hi> Talent, as well as <hi>two,</hi> for <hi>two,</hi> and five for five; and he was puniſhed as well for not improving his one, to two, as for bringing in no increaſe; And if he that had received five Talents, had brought in the increaſe but of two, I believe he had heard of it from his Lord, and beene Chidden, if not puniſhed for it. Though it be true alſo, that there is no <hi>Obligation ad ſemper,</hi> yet <hi>ſemper,</hi> as <hi>opportunity</hi> is offered; <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10.

                        <hi>He that giveth in marriage doth well, and he that giveth not, doth better.</hi>
                     </q> For 1. <hi>well</hi> and <hi>better</hi> there, do not referre to <hi>morall goodneſſe</hi> but <hi>Worldly good,</hi> in regard of the <hi>prevention</hi> of troubles, in thoſe <hi>afflicted,</hi> and perſecuting times: <hi>Marriage</hi> is, in it ſelfe, a thing <hi>indifferent,</hi> and ſo it may be <hi>good</hi> for ſome to marry, and <hi>better</hi> for others not to marry.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The matter is, how the <hi>parties</hi> are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; If a man have not the <hi>gift</hi> of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,

                     </q> If a man had the gift of continency, is was <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> (in thoſe times, <hi>for the preſent diſtreſſe, ver.</hi> 26.) not to marry, but ſtill with reſpect to <hi>Worldly,</hi> not <hi>morall</hi> good. 2.

                        <hi>That the beſt, being a ſuperlative, ſuppoſes the poſitive to be good; whereas if all were bound to do that which is beſt, that which were onely good, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; for ſo is whatever comes ſhort of what we are bound to do.</hi>
                     </q> I hope the Doctor will not deny, but <hi>works done by faith</hi> are Good; and yet, that they are not <hi>perfect</hi> in this life, that is, <hi>come ſhort</hi> of what wee are bound to doe, if not by the <hi>Law,</hi> yet by the Goſpell; will he now ſay,

                  <p>§. 48. The next <hi>Objection</hi> raiſed by him, helps to confirme the former anſwer; The Law is, <q>
                        <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, ſoul, ſtrength,</hi> &amp;c.</q> which implyes the utmoſt <hi>endeavour,</hi> to perfection, in all our obedience, He anſwers, <q>

                  <p>But what ſhall wee ſay to that <hi>Inſtance</hi> of Chriſt himſelfe; <q>
                        <hi>Who, we know, did never fail, in performing what was mans dutie in prayer, or any thing elſe; yet at that time,</hi> Luk. 22.24. <hi>prayed more earneſtly; which is a demonſtrative evidence, that the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree, is not neceſſarily ſinfull, when the higher is acceptable to God, which when it is granted, there will be no doubt but theſe freewill-offerings, will be reconcilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59453:63"/>with that command; and ſo room left for a voluntary oblation.</hi>
                     </q> But wee ſay to this, This <hi>example</hi> of Chriſt, will not be <hi>applya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to men. For Chriſt was <hi>above</hi> the Law; and did more then the <hi>Law</hi> required, and did <hi>ſupererogate</hi> in many his <hi>actions,</hi> and <hi>paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> and ſo in the degree of <hi>affection</hi> in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if not in the <hi>prayer</hi> it ſelf: But men are ſo farre from <hi>Supererogating</hi> by any ſervice, <hi>prayer,</hi> or the like; that they fall many <hi>degrees</hi> ſhort of what is required, and due from them, and ſo no <hi>room</hi> left for <hi>freewil-offerings,</hi> as his <hi>voluntary oblations.</hi> Yet thus much that example holds forth, that greater preſſures and neceſſities, call for enlargement of affections not as <hi>voluntary oblations,</hi> but as duties.</p>
                  <p>§. 50. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this makes way for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the laſt objection; <q>
                        <hi>That if it be granted poſſible for a Chriſtian, to do more, than he is commanded, he may then ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogate, as the Romaniſts teach.</hi>
                     </q> The Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or anſwers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <q>
                        <hi>There is a great difference, between offering, that a man may do more than is commanded; and that, he may do ſomething which is not commanded; The former ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes him to have done all commanded, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond may be true, though in moſt, or all other things, he have been wanting: Hee aſſerts the ſecond, not the first.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But the firſt of theſe, is juſt the <hi>ſame</hi> with the former, that by <hi>doing more</hi> than was commanded, was ſuppoſed, hee had <hi>done all</hi> that was commanded, <hi>i. e.</hi> had <hi>never ſinned;</hi> which himſelfe ſaies, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do not own.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59453:64"/>Doctor does not ſay, that the <hi>perſon never ſinned;</hi> or hath <hi>perfect</hi> obedience; but yet this he ſaies, (with the <hi>Romaniſts</hi>) that hee may doe <hi>ſomething not commanded,</hi> that is (ſay <hi>I</hi>) ſomething <hi>more</hi> than is commanded, which ſounds ill, in an <hi>Orthodox</hi> eare; and yet this is that, which the Doctor hath been <hi>labouring</hi> to prove for many <hi>ſections</hi> together. As for the ſecond, the Doctor <hi>diſclaimes</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> and ſo conſequently, (ſo farre) that of <hi>Supererogation:</hi> But yet cannot free his doctrine from ſome kind of <hi>Supererogation.</hi> For, works of <hi>Supererogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> have not their <hi>denomination,</hi> from <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> made by them; but they are therefore thought to be <hi>ſatisfactions,</hi> becauſe, they doe <hi>ſomething more</hi> than the Law required; <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerogare,</hi> is as much, as, <hi>ſuper quod erogavit lex:</hi> Yea in many reſpects ſuch <hi>works</hi> may be ſaid to <hi>Supererogate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, with reſpect to the <hi>Law</hi> it ſelf, when men think they have done <hi>more</hi> than the Law required, which makes them not <hi>Supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,</hi> but <hi>Derogatory,</hi> from the <hi>perfection</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> of God, and layes <hi>imperfection</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, (as the Doctor hath <hi>plainly</hi> done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.) 2. With reſpect had to <hi>other</hi> men, men, who attain not to that <hi>perfection</hi> (as they call it) to do <hi>ſomething more</hi> than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; as that <hi>Phariſee,</hi> that ſaid (with ſcorne and pride enough) "<hi>I am not as other
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59453:64"/>men, I faſt twice a week.</hi> And this was the note of <hi>diſcrimination,</hi> between the <hi>Haſidaej,</hi> and the <hi>Haraej,</hi> as we heard above. 3. With reſpect to the <hi>over-pleaſing</hi> and <hi>acceptance</hi> of God: They that think that they can doe <hi>ſomething not commanded,</hi> do think, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to find <hi>more,</hi> and greater <hi>acceptance</hi> from God, than they themſelves or others do, for doing onely <hi>what is commanded: Papiſts</hi> do indeed, think they can <hi>merit</hi> wich God by ſuch works, for <hi>themſelves</hi> ond <hi>others:</hi> Ours are not come ſo far yet, but they do think to find (or procure) <hi>more acceptance</hi> for their <hi>voluntary oblations</hi> here, and if not <hi>glory</hi> it ſelf, yet a greater <hi>reward,</hi> and <hi>greater glory</hi> hereafter for ſuch works. For more <hi>accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> the Doctor ſpeakes expreſly; <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. <q>
                        <hi>When in the ſervice of God, a man out of a pious affection ſhall do any thing elſe, beſide what God hath commanded, by any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular precept, this action of his, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſo much more commendable to God.</hi>
                     </q> And elſewhere, <q>
                        <hi>The more voluntary the ſervice, the more acceptable.</hi>
                     </q> What excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be made to this, ſee above at <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. and adde, If the Doctor ſhould meane it of <hi>voluntarineſſe</hi> in a <hi>preſcribed</hi> worſhip of God, it is not to the purpoſe; for even the <hi>higheſt voluntarineſſe,</hi> is there required. If he mean it of a <hi>voluntary, wil deviſed</hi> worſhip, I have ſaid, and ſay again, <q>
                        <hi>The more volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59453:65"/>the more abhominable.</hi>
                     </q> As for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that by their <hi>voluntary oblations,</hi> they do thinke and expect to finde <hi>greater glory,</hi> and <hi>reward</hi> hereafter, the Doctor is not ſo expreſſe; Yet when he makes it <q>
                        <hi>a part of prudence, to aſpire to the moſt perfect ſtate, that is, (as he implyes) Martyrdome, for his reaſon, becauſe that is the way and means, to advance us higheſt in glory;</hi>
                     </q> Sect. <q>43, 44. <hi>Knowing the greateſt perfection, to be moſt gloriouſly rewarded;</hi>
                     </q> he comes very near to think, that <hi>voluntary oblations,</hi> ſuch as voluntary <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> may procure, <hi>greater reward,</hi> than commanded worſhip. To draw to a concluſion of all; when the Doctor ſaies, <q>
                        <hi>His Doctrine forbiddeth any the moſt juſtified man, to pretend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſatisfying for others, but to work out his own ſalvation, with fear and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> i. e. <hi>with all the Humility in the world.</hi>
                     </q> This may be <hi>true</hi> in the <hi>Doctrine;</hi> but in the <hi>Practiſe,</hi> I fear it tends to <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>ſcorne,</hi> to teach men, <q>
                        <hi>That to do things not commanded, will make a man more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, and purchaſe him a greater meaſure of glory hereafter, than to do things onely commanded by God:</hi>
                     </q> Wee have too much <hi>experience</hi> of the <hi>ſucceſſe,</hi> of ſuch <hi>Doctrine,</hi> not onely in the old <hi>Haſidaej,</hi> and later <hi>Phariſees,</hi> but palpably in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> at this day; and our own late Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

                     <hi>Willworshipers,</hi> and <hi>Formaliſts,</hi> who did <hi>overlooke</hi> others (who like the <hi>Karaeans,</hi> kept cloſe to the <hi>Rule</hi> of the word, for their <hi>worſhip</hi>) with abundance of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> and <hi>inſolence;</hi> as all that knew the <hi>times,</hi> can ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently teſtifie.</p>

                  <p>Section 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is true indeed, that when the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſayes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. <hi>If any man ſeem to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, we have no ſuch cuſtom, neither the Churches of God.</hi> From hence may bee made, 1. <hi>Negatively;</hi> we, or the <hi>Churches</hi> have no ſuch <hi>cuſtome: ergo</hi> they are <hi>contentious</hi> that would induce any new practiſe into the Church. 2. <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> we <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the Churches of Chriſt have ſuch a cuſtome; <hi>ergo</hi> they are contentious that oppoſe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it. But the force of the conſequence is far ſtronger in the <hi>Negative</hi> (which is the inference of that Text) than in the <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> unleſſe ſome other conſiderations be put in: For example, the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Church had no ſuch cuſtome as the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the Maſs, <hi>praying</hi> for, or to the dead, <hi>worſhiping of</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, <hi>&amp;c. ergo</hi> they are <hi>contentious</hi> and <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious</hi> who bring them into the Church: On the other ſide, it will not follow the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical</hi> Church had a cuſtome, to obſerve the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59453:67"/>
                     <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the Jews (when they came amongſt them) to <hi>circumciſe,</hi> ſometimes to <hi>abſtain</hi> from blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to avoyd offence, and winne the Jews; <hi>ergo</hi> they that go about afterwards to <hi>lay down</hi> theſe, are contentious; this will no wayes be admitted. The reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> afterwards repealed thoſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi> cuſtomes. Two cautions therefore muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make the <hi>Affirmative</hi> conſtringent.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>cuſtome</hi> which is pleaded for, be brought into the Church by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves, for Goſpel worſhip: For he ſaies, <q>
                        <hi>We (we) have no ſuch cuſtome, nor the Churches of God.</hi>
                     </q> The Goſpel <hi>Churches</hi> by us planted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the <hi>cuſtome</hi> pleaded be grounded <hi>truly</hi> (if not ſo clearly) upon the Word of God: For this is no good argument againſt a rational Diſputant. <q>
                        <hi>The preſent Church (of</hi> Rome, <hi>ſuppoſe, or any Church, ſome centurie, or more of years after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles) hath ſuch or ſuch a cuſtom;</hi> ergo <hi>we muſt receive it, unleſs we will be counted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious.</hi>
                     </q> But this is thought a good infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: <q>
                        <hi>The Apoſtolicall pureſt Church had a cuſtom to obſerve the Lords day, the firſt day of the week,</hi> Act. 20.7. 1 Cor. 16.1, 2. <hi>inſtead of the old Sabbath;</hi> ergo <hi>that day was inſtituted by the Apoſtles, and they that reject it, or prophane it, are more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, even ſacrilegious.</hi>
                     </q> And upon theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59453:67"/>fiderations the Doctor hath conſulted ill to his own cauſe, to produce this Text for his <hi>Feſtivall:</hi> For hee dare not ſay it was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> nor can prove it was obſerved by the <hi>prime,</hi> and <hi>pureſt</hi> Church (though he oft aſſert it) then the inference is ſtrong againſt him. <q>
                        <hi>The Apoſtle, &amp; prime Apoſtolicall Church had no ſuch cuſtom as the obſervation of Chriſtmas;</hi> ergo <hi>they are contentious who plead for its continuance.</hi>
                     </q> It matters not then what the ancient uſage of the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath been; if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan not with the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the firſt Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: Which, of the Feaſt of <hi>Chriſts Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> cannot, I think, be proved; I am ſure is not performed by the learned Doctor. Nor yet that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was extant in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times; or if it were, that this <hi>cuſtome</hi> of <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> was from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>plantation</hi> of the Goſpell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, which yet he undertakes to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. The latter he firſt begins with: And that it is thus <hi>ancient</hi> he will prove, <q>
                        <hi>By one objection againſt,</hi> viz. <hi>the retaining of ſome heathen uſages, in the obſervation of it, which are undeniable Teſtimonies of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity and un-interrupted continuance of this practiſe, even from the time of our firſt converſion: For otherwiſe, it is not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable how any heathen uſage ſhould be found
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59453:68"/>adherent to it.</hi>
                     </q> But this is no way conſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent: For they might bee added (together with the <hi>Feſtival</hi> it ſelf) ſome good while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt <hi>converſion,</hi> of ſome part of this <hi>Iſland,</hi> the better to winne the reſt to a liking of Chriſtian Religion, by conforming to them in celebration of <hi>Feſtivals;</hi> as the like was done to winne the Jewes in obſerving the old <hi>Sabbath, Pentecoſt,</hi> &amp;c. <q>
                        <hi>The Apoſtles</hi> (ſaies the Doctor) <hi>to attract the Jews to the Chriſtian Religion,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <q>

                     </q> Seeing after ſo long a time as fifteen, or ſixteen hundred yeares continuance (as the Dr. thinks they ſtill attend the <hi>Feſtival;</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being more tenacious of cuſtoms, <hi>received by the Tradition of their Fathers,</hi>

                  <p>§. 3.4. For the <hi>former,</hi> that the <hi>converſion</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was early, is very likely, but not ſo early, as is pretended, but not proved: For as the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> and <hi>Monuments</hi> are very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and doubtfull, differing much one from another; ſo the Doctor himſelf is very <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> where to place the beginning, or who was the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of our converſion. <q>
                        <hi>It may be beleeved, either Apoſtolical, or very near the Apoſtles times.</hi>
                     </q> Faine would hee have us think it was by ſome <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> if he knew how to make it out. Some affirm it was <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Zelotes,</hi> Sect. 6. <q>
                        <hi>And there was ſome colour for the affirmation of</hi> Simon Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtes; <hi>That St.</hi> Peter <hi>ſtayed in</hi> Britaine <hi>ſometime, converted many, and conſtituted Churches, &amp; ordained Biſhops in the twelfth year of</hi> Nero's <hi>reign.</hi>
                     </q> But he ſlurs his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thus: <q>
                        <hi>The authority of this Writer is not great.</hi>
                     </q> He might have ſaid, <hi>Nothing worth,</hi> being contradicted by ſo many others, and by the Doctor himſelf, by and by. Yet it might be near the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times by ſome <hi>Apoſtolicall men;</hi> ſome ſay <q>
                        <hi>rather by</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph <hi>of</hi> Arimathea;</q> for ſo. Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports (from as ancient Records, and credible as any we have; for we have none very ancient or very credible, <q>
                        <hi>That</hi> Joſeph <hi>of</hi> Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea <hi>planted Chriſtianity here coming out of</hi> France.</q> Belike <hi>Creſcens</hi> ſent him hither to convert she <hi>Britains;</hi> if he did not come,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59453:69"/>and doe it himſelf: For ſo the Doctor would have it, and proves it out of Scripture, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Creſcens</hi> (<hi>ſent by</hi> St. Paul <hi>was gone into</hi> Galatia; where <hi>Galatia</hi> may ſignifie <hi>France,</hi> as ſome Authors take it, and the Doctor is willing to beleeve it: For preſently (though others contradict) hee takes it for granted, when he ſayes, <q>
                        <hi>What is ſo early affirmed in Scripture of the communicating of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell to</hi> France (<hi>i. e. by</hi> Creſcens) <hi>which is ſo near to us, removes all improbabilitie from thoſe Hiſtories which record the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Goſpel in theſe Iſlands in the Apoſtles times.</hi>
                     </q> Its eaſie to beleeve, that <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcens,</hi> if he were in <hi>France,</hi> might quickly ſtep over into <hi>Engl.</hi> but the former is yet to prove: For the Doctor knows very well, that very learned men deny, that <hi>Galatia</hi> was there ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for <hi>France;</hi> but for a part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which is far enough from <hi>England.</hi> Yea they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate it (as they think) that it was not meant of <hi>France;</hi> for which I referre him to <hi>Eſtius</hi> on the place, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. However, whether <hi>Creſcens</hi> were ever in <hi>France</hi> or no, ſure he was not in <hi>England</hi> to convert the Nation. Hear the Doctors own words: <hi>"This</hi> (which he had ſaid before) <q>
                        <hi>is an evidence, that neither</hi> Peter <hi>nor</hi> Paul, <hi>nor</hi> Creſcens, <hi>nor any of thoſe that uſually accompanied either of thoſe two Apoſtles, did bring the Chriſtian Faith to this Iſland.</hi> He might have added,

                  <p>§. 7. But the Doctor hath found one <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of moment; <q>
                        <hi>Chriſtmas day is called in our old Monument, Midwinter day; whence it may reaſonably be concluded, that when that name was firſt applyed to that day, Chriſtmas day was in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar, either coincident with, or not far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, from the Winter Solſtice: and wee continue to call the</hi> 24. <hi>of</hi> June, Midſomer <hi>day; halfe a year from the</hi> 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>How ſweetly all agree? <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was conceived, ſix months before <hi>our Lord,</hi> and and ſo born ſix months before him: Hence the <hi>Feaſtmaſters,</hi> plead his birth on the 24. of <hi>June,</hi> and his, and our Lords on the 25. of <hi>December.</hi>

                     </q> If ſo, I would ſay two things; Firſt that the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Church,</hi> of the firſt ages (or ſince) <hi>never met</hi> to inſtitute any <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> for all Churches, nor in ſpeciall, for this of <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi> Secondly, if they had met, yet that <hi>Church,</hi> had no <hi>power,</hi> to bind after Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, (if they met) if they ſaw cauſe to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them; for a reaſon anon to be given. But 2. if he take it of a <hi>particular Church,</hi> (as this of <hi>England:</hi> as here he doth) then I ſay again; 1. We read of no ſuch <hi>Cannons</hi> made by the <hi>Church,</hi> at the firſt converſion, to make the <hi>uſage</hi> ſo antient, and to bind all her Children, in after ages. 2. If we did find ſuch, yet the <hi>Succeeding Church,</hi> having the ſame <hi>Power,</hi> may annull if ſhe ſee cauſe, what was by them inſtituted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We deſire alſo to know what he means, by <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> for this is an <hi>ambiguous</hi> word, under which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do ſhroud their <hi>Superſtitious Will-worſhip: Ceremonies</hi> then, are of two ſorts. 1.

If the Doctor mean it, in the latter ſenſe (as I think he does) wee muſt again diſtinguiſh of ſuch <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> they are either <hi>dumbe</hi> and <hi>non-ſignificant,</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:59453:74"/>as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath many, or <hi>Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant,</hi> and that either, by <hi>Nature,</hi> or by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution:</hi> If <hi>ſignificant</hi> by inſtitution, then either by <hi>Divine,</hi> or <hi>Humane</hi> Inſtitution. Theſe Diſtinctions being premiſed, wee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Doctor, does not meane of the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall circumſtances,</hi> or <hi>Adjuncts</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded worſhip, for that will not ſtand him in any ſtead; nor does any man <hi>deny</hi> the Church a Power to order thoſe. But he muſt meane it, of <hi>Ceremoniall Worſhip,</hi> as oppoſed to <hi>Moral;</hi> And that not, for <hi>Dumbe</hi> or Non-ſignificant Ceremonies: thoſe he diſlikes, in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> but for <hi>Significant</hi> Ceremonies; not ſignificant by <hi>Nature,</hi> thoſe need no Inſtitution; but by <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> not <hi>Divine,</hi> (that were little leſſe than a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction) but <hi>Humane</hi> Inſtitution. Then the queſtion is this, <q>
                        <hi>Whither the Church, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall for all Churches; or a particular Church, for her own members, have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Authority to inſtitute Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Ceremonies, as parts of worſhip, which may not, upon juſt reaſons, be changed, or aboliſhed.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2.

                     <hi>New</hi> ceremonies; or elſe ceremonies may be multiplyed to the end of the world. And ſo much of the firſt, the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Church, to inſtitute Ceremonies. A word of the next.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we muſt enquire, whether if the Church have any power to ordain any <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> this of <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> be ſuch, as ſhe may ordain. We have ſaid, and ſay again, to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <hi>Holy daies,</hi> and to make them <hi>parts of Geds worſhip,</hi> is a <hi>priviledge</hi> of God alone. If now the Doctor ſhall ſay, The Church inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes this <hi>Feſtival</hi> onely as a <hi>circumſtance,</hi> or Adjunct of <hi>Worſhip</hi> commanded, it will bee little to his purpoſe, and makes it no more <hi>holy,</hi> than any other day, when the ſame <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> is performed.

                  <p>§. 10. <q>
                        <hi>Theſe are part of that eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Reformation in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath enacted for us by act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> To this we ſay;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Reformation</hi> formerly made in this Kingdome, we have good cauſe to bleſſe God for; but we know it was not ſo <hi>full</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> as the Reformers themſelves could have wiſhed, by reaſon of the times, <hi>new</hi> come out of the darkneſſe of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the <hi>tenaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of old <hi>cuſtoms,</hi> received by <hi>tradition</hi> of their Fathers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ſeems to grant that the <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and ſo the eſtabliſhment of theſe <hi>Feſtivals</hi> in this Nation, was made by the <hi>State,</hi> and not by the <hi>Church,</hi> which now is pleaded for.</p>
                  <p>§. 11. Secondly, <q>
                        <hi>This, &amp; other Feaſts of Chriſt, are in the Reformed, eſpecially the</hi> Lutheran <hi>Churches, ſtil retained, and where they are taken away in ſome Churches, by ſome ſober members wiſhed for.</hi>
                     </q> We anſwer to this; The Churches that retain theſe <hi>Feaſts</hi> (eſpecially the <hi>Lutherans</hi>) are not reputed the beſt Reformed Churches, nor by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor himſelf (I beleeve) thought fit to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>England,</hi> &amp; ſome other Churches in Doctrine and Worſhip, and ſo no fit preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for our Reformation. What private perſons wiſh or ſay, is not much to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; unleſſe their reaſons bee conſtringent. However, we are not alone, nor the firſt in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59453:77"/>this <hi>diſ-uſage</hi> of this Feſtivall: Some <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Reformed Churches, are with us, and afore us. As for the <hi>Sermons</hi> given to <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> day, by ſome that now diſuſe it (wherin <q>
                        <hi>The whole body of their publick devotions,</hi>

                  <p>§. 12.3. The laying down, or <hi>diſuſing</hi> the obſervation of this Feſtivity, <q>
                        <hi>is not an act of Diviſion or ſeparation, from either the particular Church of</hi> England, <hi>or from the Univerſall Church in all ages, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that of the first and pureſt times:</hi>
                     </q> Not the <hi>latter</hi> for certain; for we have proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the firſt and <hi>pureſt ages</hi> of the Church, did not obſerve it. Not the former, unleſſe he will yeeld, that the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in former times, was a <hi>Diviſion</hi> or ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> or the Reformation in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, was a diviſion and ſeparation from the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Church, as Papiſts ſay it was.</p>
                  <p>§. 13.4. If <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>profaneſs</hi> may be ground ſufficient to lay aſide a Cuſtome;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59453:78"/>the <hi>complexion</hi> of the <hi>times</hi> have long ſince invited to the laying aſide the uſage of this <hi>Feaſt.</hi> His pretences to the contrary, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient.</p>

                        <hi>The omiſſion of Chriſtmas ſermons and ſervices, tends not to raze out of the minds of the ignorant ſort, the ſlender knowledge they have of the birth of Chriſt, and conſequent myſteries of Religion</hi> For the <hi>Goſpell</hi> being read and preached on,</q> all the year long; they cannot but often hear of the <hi>Birth, Life, Death, Buriall,</hi> and reſurrection of Chriſt.

                        <hi>The</hi> Impatience <hi>of ſound Doctrine, and readineſſe to embrace what ever is novel</hi> is not to be found in thoſe of <hi>dee per,</hi>

<note place="margin">Serm of Reſurr.</note> I adde but one thing more; The learned Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> who pleads as ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for this <hi>Eaſter</hi> Feaſt, as any, yet founds it not upon this text, though he had occaſion to name it, but upon the <hi>Cuſtome</hi> of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is proved above, out of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> inſtituted not any <hi>Holydaies</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Lords day</hi>) therefore nor this of <hi>Eaſter.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Doctor himſelfe hath given us one <hi>ground</hi> of ſcruple, <hi>ſect.</hi> 7. when he ſaies, <q>
                        <hi>Chriſtmas day is in our old Monuments, called</hi> Midwinter <hi>day, which is the day of the Winter Solſtice,</hi>
                     </q> confeſſed by him to be a fortnight diſtant, from the 25. of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it hath been the <hi>opinion</hi> of many, if not moſt of our learned <hi>Divines,</hi> that our <hi>Lord</hi> dyed, when he was about 33. and halfe years of age, (or near unto 34. as the Doctor ſaies) Now the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was at the time of the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> about our <hi>March,</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Arabick Codex</hi> of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells,</hi> is of <hi>younger date,</hi> not able to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Sect.</hi> 37. the Doctor himſelfe, is upon his <hi>ifs,</hi> and tis probable; <q>
                        <hi>If it were framed by thoſe that ſucceeded the Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſo it is probable they were firſt intitled, Canons of Apoſtolicall men: Or if it were one of thoſe which in ſucceeding times were added and put into that volum,</hi> &amp;c.</q> This is enough to ſhake the <hi>authority</hi> of thoſe Canons, and ſo the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the Feſtivall on ſuch a day.</p>
                  <p>§. 39. Its very like that <hi>Twelfe day</hi> is of the ſame <hi>Originall,</hi> and ſame <hi>Antiquity</hi> with <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> day, or not not much younger, but both of them <hi>Poſthumous</hi> to the <hi>prime</hi> Antiquity.

                  <p>§. 40. But there is ſomething that weakens the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of this <hi>Twelfe day</hi> Feſtivall, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     </q> And the Doctor ſaies, hee is more inclined to the laſt of the three conjectures, that is, <q>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59453:97"/>queſtion, by the teſtimony of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and other Antients; <q>
                        <hi>out of the cenſuall Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of</hi> Auguſtus, <hi>the Regiſters of ſuch as were enrolled at the Taxe,</hi> Luc. 2.1. <hi>toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the place and day of the month and year when it was done.</hi>
                     </q> This indeed would end the queſtion concerning the day of <hi>Chriſts Birth,</hi> but makes yet nothing to the maine queſtion; That <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> (ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is of <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> Inſtitution; or of the <hi>next age.</hi> Lets hear what may be ſaid to thoſe Teſtimonies.

                        <hi>We have received the day from thoſe that accurately knew theſe things, and which dwell in the City of</hi> Rome.</q> Suppoſe

                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is this, <q>
                        <hi>That this Feſtivall was ſo ſuddenly publiſhed every where, and that it aroſe and flouriſhed to ſuch an height.</hi>
                     </q> But does the Father at all, go about to prove this? That which he ſaies is, <q>
                        <hi>That the preaching of the Goſpell (ſo I think he meanes) or of Chriſt, by tent makers, fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermen, and vulgar men, took the whole World, in few yeares, by the power of him that was preached.</hi>
                     </q> But he ſaies not a word, when the <hi>Feaſt of the Nativity</hi> firſt began to be celebrated.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His ſecond <hi>Demonſtration</hi> is from the great <hi>Taxing</hi> of the World by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:59453:98"/>when all went to be <hi>taxed,</hi> into his own Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: At which time <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> going up to <hi>Bethlem, Chriſt</hi> was born, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.6.7. Now the time of this Tax, was recorded in the <hi>Rolls</hi> of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> and the good <hi>Father,</hi> was certified from thence, by ſome that dwell there, that it was in ſuch a <hi>Month,</hi> and ſuch a year. All this may be granted; but this proves onely the truth and time of Chriſts birth; but not the <hi>obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the day as Feſtivall: Yes, may ſome ſay, with the Doctor, for the Father addes, <q>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. His laſt <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> is from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the time of <hi>Johns</hi> conception, which was, 6. <hi>Months,</hi> before the conception of his and our Lord; as the Scripture ſaies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.26. Now the ground of all his large diſcourſe, is upon this <hi>Suppoſition,</hi> that the <hi>meſſage</hi> of <hi>Johns</hi> conception came to <hi>Zacharias,</hi> in the month of <hi>September;</hi> from whence the ſixth month, when the <hi>Angell</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:59453:98"/>came to <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſhe conceived her Sonne, was <hi>March,</hi> and as we calculate it, the 25. day. From thence count 9. months more, and it falls to be juſt our <hi>December,</hi> and the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day thereof. But how proves the <hi>Father,</hi> the firſt, that <hi>Zacharie</hi> was officiating in the Temple, in our month of <hi>December?</hi> his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is very large: The ſum of all comes to this: Hee takes for <hi>granted,</hi> theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that <hi>Zacharie,</hi> was then <hi>high Prieſt,</hi> and ſecondly, That the time was, the <hi>Feaſt</hi> of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> and the day of <hi>expiation,</hi> on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> month, and 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the month, at which time onely the high <hi>Prieſt</hi> and he <hi>alone</hi> went into the <hi>moſt holy</hi> place. Now (ſaies the Father) <hi>Zacharie</hi> was at this time <hi>gone</hi> alone into the <hi>moſt holy place,</hi> and all the people were without praying, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.9, 10. This he proves, becauſe its ſaid, when the <hi>Angel</hi> came to him, he ſaw him ſtanding on the <hi>right ſide</hi> of the Altar of incenſe; which <hi>Zacharies</hi> lot was to burn, at that time: The <hi>Altar</hi> of burnt offerings (ſaies he) was <hi>without,</hi> and the Altar of incenſe <hi>within</hi> the Vail.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59453:99"/>
                        <hi>no concluſion can be collected, unleſſe firſt it be proved, that</hi> Zacharie, <hi>was the high Prieſt, which yet was not true: allthough this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nouriſheth his ſame opinion, in other places, by what probable argument at leaſt, led to it, I know not.</hi>
                     </q> So farre he.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Chemnitius</hi> is confident, he was not <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> by many reaſons. 1. <hi>Luke</hi> calls him ſimply <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and officiating in the order of his courſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and that was, of the courſe of <hi>Abia, ver.</hi> 5. who was not of the <hi>High Prieſts</hi> line, but an ordinary <hi>Prieſt,</hi> of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> courſe, of the 24. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.7.10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He officiated, and burnt incenſe by <hi>Lot;</hi> but ſo did not the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> but by office. <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>Incenſe</hi> was not within the <hi>Vaile,</hi> but without, and there <hi>Zacharie</hi> was ready at leaſt to burne <hi>Incenſe,</hi> when the <hi>Angell</hi> ſtood on the right ſide of it. The <hi>High Prieſt</hi> did offer his <hi>Incenſe</hi> indeed within the Vail, but that was in a <hi>Cenſer,</hi> not upon the <hi>Altar;</hi> as is ſaid, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.12. but he onely took <hi>coales</hi> from the Altar of the burnt offering; and <hi>Incenſe</hi> from the Altar of of Incenſe, and put them both in a <hi>Cenſer,</hi> and offered it <hi>within</hi> the Vail: whereas the other Prieſts offered it daily, <hi>without</hi> the Vaile. Now the <hi>Suppoſition</hi> of the Father, being ungrounded, what he builds upon it, will be farre from a demonſtration. But if all
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59453:99"/>his <hi>proofes</hi> were good, that the month was <hi>December,</hi> and the day, the 25. of that month, whereon Chriſt was born; wee aske again, what is this to prove the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the <hi>Feſtivall</hi> of the Nativitie? <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> himſelf hath much ſhaken the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Church, Univerſall, in conſtituting it, and celebrating of it, in all ages: For, it ſeems, it was very <hi>queſtionable</hi> in his time; whither it was a <hi>new</hi> or an <hi>antient</hi> cuſtom: Heare his own words,

                  <p>§. 45. His concluſion then, muſt needs be like his <hi>premiſes,</hi> weak and inſufficient, if not
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59453:100"/>
                     <hi>injurious:</hi> That, <q>
                        <hi>the faſtidious rejecting, or not obſerving the Feſtivalls of the Church Univerſall, the great daies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be looked upon, by every man, as an act of affected departure, from the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church in all ages; and not onely from the reformed Church of</hi> England.</q> An heavie <hi>charge,</hi> if it can be proved once, as it is aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted twice here, and <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. before.

                  <p n="1">1. That he hath not at all proved, that the <hi>Univerſall Church</hi> of the firſt Age, hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved any of them; nor the <hi>Univerſall</hi> Church, in many after <hi>ages,</hi> hath obſerved all thoſe which he hath named.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                     </q> (which is one of the Cautions) that this was delivered <hi>from the Apoſtles;</hi> I ſhall put in a juſt exception, in the words of the learned and honoured Lord <hi>Falkland;</hi> in his diſcourſe, <q>
                        <hi>Of the infallibility of the Church of</hi> Rome;</q> who plead, the <hi>univerſall Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Church, for their <hi>Religion,</hi> (as the Doctor does, for his <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi>) Thus he writes: <q>
                        <hi>If the Relation of one</hi> Pappias <hi>could cozen ſo farre, all the prime Doctors of the Church Chriſtian, into a beliefe of the celebration, of a thouſand years after the Reſurrection, ſo as, that not one of thoſe two firſt ages, oppoſe it, (marke that) till</hi> Dionyſius Alexandrinus, <hi>who lived at leaſt</hi> 250. <hi>yeares after Chriſt: nay, if thoſe firſt men, did not onely believe it, as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but</hi> Juſtin Martyr, <hi>ſaith, he holds it, and ſo do all that are in all parts, Orthodox Chriſtians.</hi> Irenaeus <hi>ſets it down directly for a Tradition, and relates the very words that Chriſt uſed, when he taught this; which is plainer than any other Tradition, is proved, or ſaid to be, out of Antiquity, by them (of</hi>

                     </q> &amp;c. The Doctors <hi>wiſdome</hi> can eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this to the caſe in hand. And I perceive he was aware of ſuch an <hi>objection,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labours to <hi>prevent</hi> it, by ſaying, <q>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Rule</hi> applyed to the caſe in hand, will prove, (more then the Doctor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) a <hi>light</hi> to diſcover his <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> far

                  <p n="1">1. The Rule muſt hold, onely in things, "<hi>wherein the Scripture is obſcure, or ſilent:</hi> But for <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of Feaſts, (particularly this of Chriſtmas) the Scripture is neither obſcure nor ſilent.

Feſtivalls</hi> of old, were part of the <hi>Ceremoniall yoke,</hi> upon the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and therefore to give the Church a power, to inſtitute <hi>Holydaies,</hi> is to reduce the yoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                     </q> This <hi>Chemnitius</hi> further proves, becauſe the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the firſt Ages, doe not ſo much as <hi>intimate</hi> any ſuch <hi>uſage</hi> in their times. <q>
                        <hi>No mention there is, amongſt the moſt antient, of celebrating the Feaſt of the Nativitie, till</hi> Baſills, Nazianzenes, <hi>and</hi> Chryſoſtomes <hi>time,</hi>
                     </q> who lived not till the fourth Centurie at leaſt: They ſay indeed, it was in <hi>practiſe,</hi> in ſome places, before their time; but that might be, ſome 100. more or leſſe years, and yet be farre from the <hi>firſt ages</hi> of the Church, or being <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. Another of the Doctors cautions is, it muſt be atteſted, <q>
                        <hi>without any conſiderable oppoſition.</hi>

                        <hi>Many being doubtfull, many charging the Feſtivity, with novelty, and as of late brought in:</hi>
                     </q> For a <hi>concluſion,</hi> then of all; the Doctors <hi>Cenſure</hi> is too harſh, and the <hi>Character</hi> too hard, that is ſet upon the refuſing of it. <q>

                     </q> Then ſay I, it was not an <hi>Univerſall uſage</hi> in all ages of the Church (which the Doctor hath ſo long pleaded for) for <hi>Juſtinus</hi> lived in the ſixt <hi>Century:</hi> I know what hee anſwers to it: <q>

                        <hi>Dedicating daies to to Saints; Invocating them in their prayers; Making the obſervation of them neceſſary: The daies themſelves holy, holyer than other daies, than the Lords day: placing the worſhip of God

                  <p>§. 77. <q>
                        <hi>Whither ſuch an antient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church of Chriſt, by name, the anniverſarie feaſt of Chriſts birth, though it be not affirmed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Chriſt, or inſtituted by the Apoſtles, or (in it ſelfe conſidered, without reſpect to the Inſtitution) abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to the being of a Church; yet being thus (more than lawfull) pious in it ſelfe; proper in reſpect of the ground, primitively Catholick, (if not Apoſtolick) in reſpect of the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be lawfully aboliſhed.</hi>
                     </q> &amp;c. Wherein the Doctor takes for granted, theſe things, which he hath not proved.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this <hi>Feſtivall</hi> is of ſo antient Inſtitution, <q>
                        <hi>as primitively Catholick, if not Apoſtolick</hi> Seeing it hath beene made appear to be, neither 1.</q> 
                     <hi>Apoſtolicke,</hi> or 2. a <hi>Primitive Inſtitution,</hi> nor 3. Of <hi>Catholick</hi> obſervation, till at leaſt the 400. yeare, by his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it is <q>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59453:106"/>in it ſelfe.</hi>
                     </q> When at moſt, it is but a thing <hi>Indifferent</hi> in its uſe, and in its <hi>Abuſe,</hi> by <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Willworſhip,</hi> more than unlawfull; impious</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That ſuch an <hi>Antient Inſtitution</hi> (if it were proved ſo) abuſed to <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>profaneſſe,</hi> may not by a particular <hi>Church,</hi> or Chriſtian <hi>Magiſtate</hi> be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aboliſhed, without regard to the <hi>Univerſall,</hi> the <hi>Univerſall</hi> Church being never like to meet, or if they could (the greateſt part being <hi>Antichriſtian</hi>) unlike ever to <hi>conſent</hi> to the aboliſhing of it. Till the Doctor ſhall prove theſe things; a further anſwer is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I come to his laſt queſtion, which is this: <q>
                        <hi>Whither by any obligation of conſcience it appear neceſſary to be thus aboliſhed, on this onely ground, of truth, becauſe the following dayes have ſometimes beene miſpent in riot</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by ſome wicked men.</hi>
                     </q> But here again, the Doctor takes for <hi>granted,</hi> what hee hath not proved, <hi>viz.</hi> That the onely <hi>ground</hi> of truth, or onely <hi>true ground</hi> of <hi>aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> this <hi>Feſtivall,</hi> was the Riot commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in the following daies; whereas the principall <hi>charge</hi> againſt it was, the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,</hi> and <hi>Willworſhip,</hi> attending the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:59453:106"/>of it; though the Riot and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the following daies, might juſtly adde an <hi>Aggravation</hi> to them; and call for a <hi>Reformation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, for a <hi>concluſion</hi> of all, wee ſhall make bold, to propound ſome <hi>queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to the Doctor, or any that ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this cauſe; And they are theſe.</p>
